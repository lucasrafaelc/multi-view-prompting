The course texts were too basic , and for intro level students , I expected something more challenging form the UMUC experience .####[['NULL', 'texts', 'too basic', 'Neutral']]

One of the bizarre things you'll notice about Capella and their students is that they refer to themselves as " learners " - that should be almost offensive to anyone who is really concerned with the attainment of a genuinely rigorous educational undertaking : a cat can learn to use a litter box , a rat can learn to use a Skinner box , a dog can learn to drool when a bell has been struck .####[['NULL', 'that', 'almost offensive', 'Negative'], ['NULL', 'students', 'bizarre', 'Negative']]
