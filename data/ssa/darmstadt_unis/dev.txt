The equipment used in our courses was often out-of-date , as was the instructor .####[['courses', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'out-of-date']]
The course texts were too basic , and for intro level students , I expected something more challenging form the UMUC experience .####[['texts', 'NULL', 'Neutral', 'too basic']]
It doesn't help that the faculty and administration deliberately spies on students in student groups , plants information in the groups , and seeks to destroy the student groups when the messges get to negative about UMUC .####[['UMUC', 'messges', 'Negative', 'to negative'], ['faculty and administration', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'seeks to destroy'], ['faculty and administration', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'deliberately spies']]
I thought the courses would be more challenging , but because anyone can enroll in a course , the instructors have to dumb it down so everyone can enjoy .####[['courses', 'NULL', 'Neutral', 'more challenging']]

UMUC should be blacklisted from US installations and banned from taxayer contracts handed out by the Department of Defense and the US Army , until it ceases its relationship with Household International .####[['UMUC', 'NULL', 'Neutral', 'should be blacklisted']]
It looks again like UMUC will do anything for money , even profiteering off soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .####[['UMUC', 'NULL', 'Neutral', 'looks again like UMUC will do anything']]
In general I have been pleased with UOP instruction and technical support is excellent , but their response times with the newsgroups are often unacceptable .####[['UOP', 'NULL', 'Positive', 'pleased']]
UOP needs to put some more money into infrastructure even if it has to take some away from their huge advertising budget .####[['UOP', 'NULL', 'Neutral', 'needs']]
Slow response times or no connectivity at all are becoming much too frequent as they push for more students without sufficiently upgrading infrastructure .####[['they', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'push']]

Having attended real universities , prior to paying a huge amount of money to Capella , I was appalled at the lack of academic integrity basically , pay your money and you'll finish .####[['Capella', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'appalled']]
One of the bizarre things you'll notice about Capella and their students is that they refer to themselves as " learners " - that should be almost offensive to anyone who is really concerned with the attainment of a genuinely rigorous educational undertaking : a cat can learn to use a litter box , a rat can learn to use a Skinner box , a dog can learn to drool when a bell has been struck .####[['that', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'almost offensive'], ['students', 'NULL', 'Negative', 'bizarre']]
