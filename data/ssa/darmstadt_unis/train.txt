As the president of the ASB at the Long Beach campus I have had very many mixed feelings when it comes to DeVry . . . Im a 7th term Computer Engineering Technology major and I really think that devry has kind of gone through alot of problems ever since their " hay-day " back in the mid-late ninties...for any prospective students , here is my pro/con list for you : //----------------------------- // // PROS // //----------------------------- ---small class sizes , on the average your classes will have between 6 - 15 students . . . usually on the smaller side .####[['class sizes', 'NULL', 'Positive', '---small']]
that doesnt sound like much , but even if your professor sucks , at least hes only ten feet away rather than 400 in a lecture hall ---expedient education devry uses a trimester based system , which means that you only have 6 weeks off for the whole year ; however , you graduate in three if you take the standard course load of 17.68 units per tri ---abet/tac accreditation devry has had accreditation for a long time now and here at the long beach campus , abet tac gave us the longest accreditation that they offer .####[['education', 'NULL', 'Positive', '---expedient']]
---job placement i had two friends last semester that graduated with 3.5 and 3.9 and both were offered engineering positions that offered their starting pay at 50k and 65k respectively there are tons of jobs for us CET's and EET's...that if you work hard in them your looking at 6-figure salaries within 10 years easily //----------------------------- // // CONS // //----------------------------- ---bad profs while almost every school has em....we seem to draw them like flies .####[['profs', 'NULL', 'Negative', '---bad']]
